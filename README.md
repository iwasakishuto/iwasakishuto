![Hello. I'm Shuto Iwasaki, a 4th year student in the department of Bioinformatics at the University of Tokyo. I'm interested in the relationship between phenotypes and genotypes, and miRNA functions in synaptic plasticity, and their influence on higher cognitive functions (especially learning and memory).](https://github.com/iwasakishuto/iwasakishuto/raw/master/bio.gif)
